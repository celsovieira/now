									<h2 class="major">Now, Exaiphnês, and the Present Moment in Ancient Philosophy
									</h2>
									<p>The experience of time is among the most fundamental features of human existence. The present thereby serves as a basis by means of which we can make sense of both past and future; thus our experience of the present, which we capture in notions like “the now”, “the instant of time”, or “the present moment”, is of special concern. The problem of the present moment remains a source of lively philosophical debate and the ancient ideas are still a constitutive part of it, which is the motivation for organizing the conference “Now, Exaiphnes and the Present Moment in Ancient Philosophy”. The conference will bring together an international group of leading scholars working on these problems in different authors and traditions.

									</h2>
								
										We are pleased to invite two to three speakers through this call for papers.

										At the moment we hope the conference to take place in person, but are planning for a hybrid format as well. We expect the papers to be submitted to be about 30-45 minutes; each session will last an hour for the presentation and discussion combined. We will cover travel within Eu-rope and accommodation.
										<p>										
										Submit either full papers or extended abstracts of 1000-1500 words for blind review in English or German
								  to Celso Vieira (Celso.DeOliveiraVieira@rub.de). <br>
										The submission deadline is January 03, 2022.
										The notification of acceptance will be at the beginning of February.

							</h2>
							
						
							<p>The experience of time is among the most fundamental features of human existence. The present thereby serves as a basis by means of which we can make sense of both past and future; thus our experience of the present, which we capture in notions like “the now”, “the instant of time”, or “the present moment”, is of special concern. We are made aware of the moment of time through motion and changes, and since the present moment seems to be when we experience these changes, our conception of the “now” is strongly connected with the notion of change. But experiencing a change means experiencing that something turns from being F to not being F, or from F to not-F. If the instants when something is F and not-F are the same instant, however, then the thing seems to be both F and not-F at the same time, and we seem to end up with a contradiction. This threatening inconsistency prompted several influential answers in ancient times: for example, Heraclitus may seem to endorse this inconsistency, while Parmenides seems to have concluded that time and change are thus unreal. Plato develops the notion of exaiphnês to suggest that the turning from F to not-F occurs outside of time. And Aristotle develops both Parmenidean and Platonic intuitions to argue that change is continuous and the segmentation of time into ‘nows’ occurs in thought.
